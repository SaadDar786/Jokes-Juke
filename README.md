# Jokes-Juke
Jokes Juke (Objective-C)

This is a simple application which fetches the Jokes from icndb and display on the screen. I have tried to cover the following in this project. This project will help in simplyfing the use and integration of RestKit and the object mapping. The implementation of MVVM and last but not the least, the dependancy managment of the framework through coca pods.

# Controls
 1. TableViewController
 2. TableViewCell (Custom Joke Cell)
 3. UIRefreshControl (Pull to refresh the Jokes on the screen)
 
# FrameWorks
 1. RestKit

# Dependancy Management
 1. Coca Pods

# Design Pattern
 1. MVVM
 2. Delagation for communication between Service & UI
 3. Facade

# Improvements/Updates
 1. Updating UI with autolayouts to work on different device size and orientation change.
 2. Implementing the details screen for every Joke.
 3. Share a joke with friends via Facebook/Linkedin/Whatsapp/Twitter
